        3/29/2025: This is another archive of a How-To post I made on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ManjaroLinux/comments/iax5q2/howto_install_the_official_cisco_anyconnect_vpn/">Reddit</a>, just in case that post gets taken down too.
    
        
        <div class="title is-1">How to install Cisco AnyConnect VPN on Arch Linux Distributions using the Tarball</div>
        <div class="content">
        <p>
        Hello All!
        Before I begin, I'm posting this here since the Manjaro Forums (original place I posted this HowTo as I was using it 100% at the time) got destroyed in an update, as some of you already know. Thankfully, my thread got saved in the archive. However, in the event that another update process ruins the archive, I'm posting yet another backup HowTo guide here, since I'm a Reddit user now:
          </p>
        <div class="box">The Actual HowTo Guide</div>
        
        <p>I created a new how-to guide for a few reasons:
        </p><p><div class="box has-background-info-light has-text-dark">The cisco-anyconnect-tarball changes are now merged to cisco-anyconnect, making the old guide (and the old -tarball package) useless.</div>
        </p><p><div class="box has-background-info-light has-text-dark">I have new information regarding how to add the tarball to the package installer, for both the CLI and Pamac.</div>
        </p><p><div class="box has-background-info-light has-text-dark">I didn't get edit permissions until very soon after I made this post public.</div>
        </p><p><div class="box has-background-info-light has-text-dark">Since I got flag/edit permissions after I made this post, I flagged the original post, and it's now been unlisted.</div>
        </p><p>For some users, there won't be an option to include a link, so I'll specify how to include the tarball locally instead.
        </p><p>With that in mind, here's the new (updated) how-to guide for the tarball:
        </p><p><div class="subtitle is-5">CLI:</div>
        </p><p>If yay is not installed, do:
        </p><p><div class="box has-text-success">sudo pacman -S yay</div>
        </p><p>Then, run:
        </p><p><div class="box has-text-success has-background-black">yay -S cisco-anyconnect </div> 
        </p><p>This will fail, but that's ok. You want to create the cisco-anyconnect directory. This can be found in:
        </p><p><div class="box has-text-success has-background-black">/home/$USER/.cache/yay/cisco-anyconnect</div>
        </p><p>Copy the tarball here. Then, install again, but instead edit the PKGBUILD script within the installation command:
        </p><p><div class="box has-text-success has-background-black">yay -S cisco-anyconnect --editmenu</div>
        </p><p>Say None (N) to CleanBuild, None (N) to showing diffs (or All (A) if you really want to see the diffs), and All (A) to editing the PKGBUILD.
        </p><p>At the top you'll see:
        </p><p><div class="box has-text-success has-background-black">_source="installer" # if installing from .sh installer #_source="tarball"     # if installing from .tar.gz package</div>
        </p><p>Change it to:
        </p><p><div class="box has-text-success has-background-black">#_source="installer"   # if installing from .sh installer _source="tarball" # if installing from .tar.gz package</div>
        </p><p>Scroll down and you'll see:
        </p><p><div class="box has-text-success has-background-black">if [[ "${_source}" == "tarball" ]]; then     _filename="anyconnect-linux64-${pkgver}-predeploy-k9.tar.gz"</div>
        </p><p>Make sure the _filename variable is the same as your tarball. Yours may not be by default because Cisco, that's why.
        </p><p>Save the PKGBUILD, close, and complete the installation process as normal.
        </p><p><div class="subtitle is-5">Post-install</div>
        </p><p>Finally, run the following command as root:
        </p><p><div class="box has-text-success  has-background-black">systemctl enable --now vpnagentd</div>
        </p><p>And that's all there is to it!
        </p><p>If anyone needs Pamac instructions I'll provide them in a separate comment. I don't think anyone will need them, but if someone really needs to do this in Pamac I know how.
        </p><p>If there are any other questions feel free to ask either here or on the AUR page, linked above. I would ask here if it's a simple question, but ask at the AUR page if it's more complicated.
        </p><p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        </p><p>I don't know if this is necessarily the right place to post this HowTo guide but it's in direct relation to the old Manjaro forum so from my understanding this counts. Please let me know, like before, if you have any questions!
        </p><p><div class="subtitle is-3">Archived Pamac Instructions from Reddit Comment</div>
        </p><p>Alright.
        </p><p>First you want to download your AnyConnect executable, then select the cisco-anyconnect package from the AUR in pamac. Then go to the "build files" section
        </p><p>From there the process is similar to using the shell, i.e.:
        </p><p>At the top you'll see:
        </p><p><div class="box has-text-success has-background-black">_source="installer" # if installing from .sh installer #_source="tarball"     # if installing from .tar.gz package</div>
        </p><p>Change it to:
        </p><p><div class="box has-text-success has-background-black">#_source="installer"   # if installing from .sh installer _source="tarball" # if installing from .tar.gz package  </div> 
        </p><p>Scroll down and you'll see:
        </p><p><div class="box has-text-success has-background-black">if [[ "${_source}" == "tarball" ]]; then     _filename="anyconnect-linux64-${pkgver}-predeploy-k9.tar.gz" </div> 
        </p><p>Make sure the _filename variable is the same as your tarball. Yours may not be by default because Cisco, that's why.
        </p><p>One last step though, you'll need to change this line:
        </p><p><div class="box has-text-success has-background-black">source=("file://${_filename}" "vpnagentd.service" "anyconnect.sh" "anyconnect.csh" "AnyConnectLocalPolicy.xml")</div>
        </p><p>to match your Cisco tarball location directory. i.e.:
        </p><p><div class="box has-text-success">source=("file:///home/$USER/Downloads/${_filename}" "vpnagentd.service" "anyconnect.sh" "anyconnect.csh" "AnyConnectLocalPolicy.xml")</div>
        </p><p>(disclaimer, I don't remember if the 3 /'s after file: is supposed to be one slash, but I left that in regardless!)
        </p><p>After that hit install! One thing to be mindful of is your Anyconnect version, if you're on a lower version you'll have to get one of the AUR packages and build the image from one of the downloadable image files, starting with version 4.7-00136 (the version I contributed to!)
        </p>
            <div class="heightx3"></div>
            <p>
              DISCLAIMER! I do not own nor have I worked on the production nor distribution of Cisco Anyconnect including its tarball.
              I simply wrote the guide and was the first to figure out how to install Cisco Anyconnect via the tarball on Arch distros using an Arch Linux Package.
               I feel this guide is at least a little helpful to see especially at 3AM when you might not have much time to work on such a thing.
