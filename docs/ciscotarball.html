        <h1 class="has-text-white">How to install Cisco AnyConnect VPN on Arch Linux Distributions using the Tarball</h1>

        <p>
        Hello All!
        Before I begin, I'm posting this here since the Manjaro Forums (original place I posted this HowTo as I was using it 100% at the time) got destroyed in an update, as some of you already know. Thankfully, my thread got saved in the archive. However, in the event that another update process ruins the archive, I'm posting yet another backup HowTo guide here, since I'm a Reddit user now:
          </p>
        <h2 class="has-text-white">The Actual HowTo Guide</h2>
        
        <p>I created a new how-to guide for a few reasons:
        </p><p><ul><li>The cisco-anyconnect-tarball changes are now merged to cisco-anyconnect, making the old guide (and the old -tarball package) useless.</li>
        </p><p><li>I have new information regarding how to add the tarball to the package installer, for both the CLI and Pamac.</li>
        </p><p><li>I didn't get edit permissions until very soon after I made this post public.</li>
        </p><p><li>Since I got flag/edit permissions after I made this post, I flagged the original post, and it's now been unlisted.</li></ul>
        </p><p>For some users, there won't be an option to include a link, so I'll specify how to include the tarball locally instead.
        </p><p>With that in mind, here's the new (updated) how-to guide for the tarball:
        </p><p><h5 class="has-text-white">CLI:</h5>
        </p><p>If yay is not installed, do:
        </p><p><blockquote class="has-background-black has-text-success">sudo pacman -S yay</blockquote>
        </p><p>Then, run:
        </p><p><blockquote class="has-background-black has-text-success">yay -S cisco-anyconnect</blockquote>
        </p><p>This will fail, but that's ok. You want to create the cisco-anyconnect directory. This can be found in:
        </p><p><blockquote class="has-background-black has-text-success">/home/$USER/.cache/yay/cisco-anyconnect</blockquote>
        </p><p>Copy the tarball here. Then, install again, but instead edit the PKGBUILD script within the installation command:
        </p><p><blockquote class="has-background-black has-text-success">yay -S cisco-anyconnect --editmenu</blockquote>
        </p><p>Say None (N) to CleanBuild, None (N) to showing diffs (or All (A) if you really want to see the diffs), and All (A) to editing the PKGBUILD.
        </p><p>At the top you'll see:
        </p><p><blockquote class="has-background-black has-text-success">_source="installer" # if installing from .sh installer #_source="tarball"     # if installing from .tar.gz package</blockquote>
        </p><p>Change it to:
        </p><p><blockquote class="has-background-black has-text-success">#_source="installer"   # if installing from .sh installer _source="tarball" # if installing from .tar.gz package</blockquote>
        </p><p>Scroll down and you'll see:
        </p><p><blockquote class="has-background-black has-text-success">if [[ "${_source}" == "tarball" ]]; then     _filename="anyconnect-linux64-${pkgver}-predeploy-k9.tar.gz"</blockquote>
        </p><p>Make sure the _filename variable is the same as your tarball. Yours may not be by default because Cisco, that's why.
        </p><p>Save the PKGBUILD, close, and complete the installation process as normal.
        </p><p><h5 class="has-text-white">Post-install</h5>
        </p><p>Finally, run the following command as root:
        </p><p><blockquote class="has-background-black has-text-success">systemctl enable --now vpnagentd</blockquote>
        </p><p>And that's all there is to it!
        </p><p>If anyone needs Pamac instructions I'll provide them in a separate comment. I don't think anyone will need them, but if someone really needs to do this in Pamac I know how.
        </p><p>If there are any other questions feel free to ask either here or on the AUR page, linked above. I would ask here if it's a simple question, but ask at the AUR page if it's more complicated.
        </p><p><div class="block"></div>
        </p><p>I don't know if this is necessarily the right place to post this HowTo guide but it's in direct relation to the old Manjaro forum so from my understanding this counts. Please let me know, like before, if you have any questions!
        </p><p><h3 class="has-text-white">Archived Pamac Instructions from Reddit Comment</h3>
        </p><p>Alright.
        </p><p>First you want to download your AnyConnect executable, then select the cisco-anyconnect package from the AUR in pamac. Then go to the "build files" section
        </p><p>From there the process is similar to using the shell, i.e.:
        </p><p>At the top you'll see:
        </p><p><blockquote class="has-background-black has-text-success">_source="installer" # if installing from .sh installer #_source="tarball"     # if installing from .tar.gz package</blockquote>
        </p><p>Change it to:
        </p><p><blockquote class="has-background-black has-text-success">#_source="installer"   # if installing from .sh installer _source="tarball" # if installing from .tar.gz package</blockquote>
        </p><p>Scroll down and you'll see:
        </p><p><blockquote class="has-background-black has-text-success">if [[ "${_source}" == "tarball" ]]; then     _filename="anyconnect-linux64-${pkgver}-predeploy-k9.tar.gz"</blockquote>
        </p><p>Make sure the _filename variable is the same as your tarball. Yours may not be by default because Cisco, that's why.
        </p><p>One last step though, you'll need to change this line:
        </p><p><blockquote class="has-background-black has-text-success">source=("file://${_filename}" "vpnagentd.service" "anyconnect.sh" "anyconnect.csh" "AnyConnectLocalPolicy.xml")</blockquote>
        </p><p>to match your Cisco tarball location directory. i.e.:
        </p><p><blockquote class="has-background-black has-text-success">source=("file:///home/$USER/Downloads/${_filename}" "vpnagentd.service" "anyconnect.sh" "anyconnect.csh" "AnyConnectLocalPolicy.xml")</blockquote>
        </p><p>(disclaimer, I don't remember if the 3 /'s after file: is supposed to be one slash, but I left that in regardless!)
        </p><p>After that hit install! One thing to be mindful of is your Anyconnect version, if you're on a lower version you'll have to get one of the AUR packages and build the image from one of the downloadable image files, starting with version 4.7-00136 (the version I contributed to!)
        </p>
            <div class="heightx3"></div>
            <p>
              DISCLAIMER! I do not own nor have I worked on the production nor distribution of Cisco Anyconnect including its tarball.
              I simply wrote the guide and was the first to figure out how to install Cisco Anyconnect via the tarball on Arch distros using an Arch Linux Package.
               I feel this guide is at least a little helpful to see especially at 3AM when you might not have much time to work on such a thing.
